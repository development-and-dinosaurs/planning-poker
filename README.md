# Prehistoric Planning Poker

[![Prehistoric Planning Poker](poker-logo.png 'Prehistoric Planning Poker logo')](https://poker.developmentanddinosaurs.co.uk/)

The coolest dinosaur themed planning poker application for agile refinement 
ceremonies.

Head to 
[https://poker.developmentanddinosaurs.co.uk/](https://poker.developmentanddinosaurs.co.uk/)
to see it in action, or you build it yourself instead!

## Self Hosting

Prehistoric Planning Poker is simple to self-host. The entire application is
distilled into a single executable jar file that can be run anywhere with a JVM.

Simply build the application from source using the included Gradle wrapper, and
then run the resulting jar file. You could probably even put it in Docker or 
something neat like that! Oh, hey maybe I could provide a Docker image, that
would be cool.

### Build from source

```shell
./gradlew jar
```

### Run jar

```shell
java -jar build/libs/planning-poker.jar
```

The application will spin up on ports 80 and 443 on localhost, so you'll be able
to access the application after running the jar by navigating
to <https://localhost>.

## Hosting on AWS

You can also host the application on AWS mostly out of the box.

All infrastructure required is defined in the [infra](/infra) directory. Most
resources are deployed using the CDK, though some are references to
infrastructure created manually.

All infrastructure fits within AWS free-tier limits, so you can try it out for
free. For 12 months anyway. 

## Hosting Elsewhere

You can host the application anywhere with a JVM, so shared hosting is probably
out of the picture, but you should be able to find something suitable in Google
Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, or a VPS.

There are no explicit instructions for this - but it will be very similar to
self-hosting. Just on someone else's server. _Cloud Computing_â„¢.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome but not expected. The ethos of this project is that
contributions should be at least one of the following (in order of importance):

- Silly
- Fun
- Useful

All contributions should be written in Kotlin where possible - _especially_ 
where doing something else would be smarter.
